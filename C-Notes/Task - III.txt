Que 1 : Write a 'C' program to take the marks of a student in 5 subjects as input and 
		determine how many subjects have marks greater than or equal to 35
		and how many have marks less than 35. 
------- The program should not use any control statements (if, else, switch, etc.) or the ternary operator. 

Sample input  : int sub1 = 38, sub2 = 34, sub3 = 35, sub4 = 78, sub5 = 20

Sample Output : Pass in 3 subject and fail in 2 subject.  


Que 2 :  A shopkeeper buys a TV set for Rs. 3500 and sells it at a profit of 27%. Apart from this a 
			VAT of 12.7% and Service Charge is 3.87% is charged. 
-------  Write a C program to Display total selling price, profit along with vat and service charge.
         To calculate the selling price, profit, VAT, and service charge, follow these steps:

         1) Calculate the selling price:

            Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

            Selling Price = Rs. 3500 + (27% of Rs. 3500)


         2) Calculate the profit:

            Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price


         3) Calculate VAT:

            VAT = 12.7% of Selling Price

	
         4) Calculate Service Charge:

            Service Charge = 3.87% of Selling Price

   Ques - 3
---------------------

 without using ternary operator and control statments.
--------

Sample input : int a = 10
Sample Output : EVEN

Sample input : int a = 125
Sample Output : ODD


Que 4 :  Write a 'C' program to check and print the Maximum number among two numbers without using ternary operator and control statments.
--------

Sample input : int a = 10 , b = 20
Sample Output : MAX = 20



 Que 5 :  Write a 'C' program to reverse the given 3 digit number without using control statments.
--------

Sample input : int a = 123;
Sample Output : reverse =  321

Ques 6:
-----------
Write a 'C' program to check and print the minimum number among two numbers  using ternary operator.
--------

Sample input : int a = 10 , b = 200
Sample Output : Min = 100

Ques 7
------------
  Write a 'C' program to check and print the Maximum number among three numbers using ternary operator.

Sample input : int a = 10 , b = 200, c = 134;
Sample Output : MAX = 200

Sample input : int a = 300 , b = 200, c = 134;
Sample Output : MAX = 300

Sample input : int a = 300 , b = 300, c = 300;
Sample Output : All are same

Daily C programming practice â€“ solving problems, improving logic, and mastering C one day at a time.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of C programming. It contains a collection of programs, exercises, and mini-projects written in C to improve problem-solving skills, deepen understanding of core concepts, and build programming discipline through consistent practice.

### ðŸ§  Goals:
- Practice C programming every day
- Strengthen logic and algorithmic thinking
- Explore data structures, file handling, pointers, etc.
- Track growth and learning progress

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure (if applicable):
- `basics/` â€“ Syntax, loops, conditions
- `arrays/` â€“ 1D, 2D arrays and problems
- `strings/` â€“ String manipulation
- `functions/` â€“ Custom and recursive functions
- `file_handling/` â€“ Working with files
- `mini_projects/` â€“ Small complete applications
